Recently, Amendola et al. proposed a geometrical theory of gravity containing higher-order derivative terms (Amendola
et al. in Phys Lett B 811:135923, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2020.135923, arXiv:2006.04209). The authors introduced
anticurvature scalar (A), which is the trace of the inverse of the Ricci tensor (Aμν  R−1μν ). In this work, we consider two classes of
Ricci-inverse—Class I and Class II—models. Class I models are of the form f (R, A) where f is a function of Ricci and anticurvature
scalars. Class II models are of the form F(R, Aμν Aμν ) where F is a function of Ricci scalar and square of anticurvature tensor. For
both these classes of models, we numerically solve the modified Friedmann equations in the redshift range 1500 < z < 0. We show
that the late-time evolution of the Universe, i.e., evolution from matter-dominated epoch to accelerated expansion epoch, can not be
explained by these two classes of models. Using the reduced action approach, we show that we can not bypass the no-go theorem
for Ricci-inverse gravity models. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the early-Universe cosmology.
