A large number of dark energy and modified gravity models lead to the same expansion history of the
Universe, hence making it difficult to distinguish them from observations. To make the calculations
transparent, we consider fðRÞ gravity with a pressureless matter without making any assumption about the
form of f(R). Using the late-time expansion history realizations constructed by Shafieloo et al. [Phys. Rev.
D 98, 083526 (2018)], we explicitly show for any fðRÞ model that the Bardeen potentials Ψ and Φ evolve
differently. For an arbitrary fðRÞ model that leads to late-time accelerated expansion, we explicitly show
that |Ψ + Φ| and its time derivative evolves differently than the ΛCDM model at lower redshifts. We show
that the Ψ/Φ has significant deviation from unity for larger wave numbers. We discuss the implications of
the results for the cosmological observations.
