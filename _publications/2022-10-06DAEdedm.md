A classical field theory description (which can be obtained from an ) of dark energy–dark matter interaction is considered. 
Demanding that the interaction strength in the dark sector must have a field theory description and a fluid description, a 
unique form of interaction strength is obtained. It is shown that the one-to-one mapping between the classical field theory 
description and the phenomenological fluid description of dark energy–dark matter interaction exists only for this unique form 
of interaction. Then a novel autonomous system and its stability analysis for the general interacting dark sector is introduced, 
followed by the background analysis for a specific potential and interaction function.
